# Observability/Production utils KF components

Repository of various observability components for ML production pipelines, mostly based on TFX and TFDV.  
Current ideas are around:

- [X] Data skew(train)/drift(predict) checker
    - ``` 01_skew-drift-validator```
- [ ] General data preparation components
- [X] General data prediction integrations and components
- ``` 02_prediction_stuff```
- [ ] Uber component for relaunching models based on different inputs (accuracy metrics, schema changes, drift ..)
- [ ] Ground truth checker
- [ ] Continuous model improvement
